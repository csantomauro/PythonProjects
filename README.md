# PythonProjects

Welcome to the **PythonProjects** repository! This repository is a collection of small Python projects that I have created to practice and learn Python programming. Each project is designed to explore different aspects of Python, from basic scripting to more advanced logic and algorithms.

## Projects

1. **Number Guessing Game**
   - **guess(x):** A simple game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and `x`. The game provides hints if the guess is too low or too high.
   - **computer_guess(x):** In this variation, the computer attempts to guess a number that the user is thinking of. The user provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
   - **clever_computer_guess(x):** An optimized version of the computer guessing game, where the computer uses binary search logic to guess the number more efficiently.

2. **Mad Libs Game**
   A fun word game where users input words like adjectives, nouns, and verbs, which are then inserted into a pre-defined story template to generate humorous and creative narratives. The user can choose between three different Mad Libs stories:
   - **Story 1:** A day at the beach.
   - **Story 2:** A spooky mansion.
   - **Story 3:** A mad scientist's experiment.

3. **Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**
   A digital version of the classic hand game where the user plays against the computer. The game randomly selects rock, paper, or scissors for the computer, and the user does the same. The program then determines the winner based on the standard rules:
   - **Rock beats Scissors**
   - **Scissors beats Paper**
   - **Paper beats Rock**
